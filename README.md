# Birdybook is a tool for busy faculty.

**it makes it simple to get teaching tools on your first try**

Birdybook just connects you to existing public publisher resources, which tend to be buried inside confusing websites. 



Save your brain for harder problems:
- rocket science (üöÄüî¨)
- prepping for class
- an on time grant proposal
- trying to not get protested by the left or the right wing students on campus


Here's a demo. Clicking on it will take you to the live beta.

You can see the codebase, but there's a lot of cruft. 
The project lives inside the server.js file, mostly. Public/client.jss and style.css too. And then the view is rendered via pug/jade at index.jade. 

Logs to an airtable for my records via airtableLog, imprints, knownImprint. It's my first try at programming and it's got some weird structure.
